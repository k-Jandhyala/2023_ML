This functionality is extremely useful and important for any engineer\n","or computer scientist developing code as it allows module level (or unit) testing of functions and\n","methods. The tests are output from the standard Python interpreter and cut/pasted into\n","“docstrings”. Here’s a reference link. To insert a doctest in your code, you’ll need to import\n","doctest. Then to insert a test use three double quotes to delimit the test (e.g. put 3 quotes\n","before and after the test code. You may insert comments using the standard comment hashtag\n","symbol (#) to document the tests you are running. Then use three greater-than symbols to\n","identify the test code (e.g. setting up variables and calling the function. Finally, list the expected output and run `doctest.testmod()`.
